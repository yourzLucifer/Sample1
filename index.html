  <h1>Happy 11-Month Anniversary, My Love!</h1>
  <p>
    From your Anshu 💖 to my Shree 💫.<br><br>
    I can't believe it's already been 11 months since we started this journey together. Time has flown by, but every day with you, even from miles away, has been special in its own way. Looking back, I remember the first time we talked, how everything felt so natural, like we'd known each other forever. It's crazy how much we've grown together, how much we've shared, and how much I've learned from you. 🌟<br><br>
    In these 11 months, we've laughed 😂, we've had our little fights 😅, and we've learned so much about each other. I've seen sides of you that I love more and more every day. I've seen how kind you are 💖, how strong you are 💪, and how much you care for the people you love. Even though we're far apart, you've made me feel so close to you. Every text 💬, every call 📞, every moment shared feels like you're right beside me. You make everything better just by being you. 💕<br><br>
    <span class="special-text">I love you more than words can say 💕✨, and I can't wait for many more months and years with you.</span><br><br>
